To keep a list of all my disliked videos as a playlist and be accessible to me.  
  
Plan :  
1.Use yt api to retrieve list.  
2.use yt api to export as a playlist on youtube.  
  
Issues :  
1.totalResults (no of disliked videos) does not match the actual count of videos in the result.  
2.Quotas very small.(10,000 units). Adding one video amounts to 50 units.  
  
Observations:  
1.Youtube allows multiple playlists with the same name.  
2.Youtube allows videos to be repeated in a playlist.
