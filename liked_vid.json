Little owls have always been one of my favourite birds to watch, but I\u2019ve never been able to film their secret lives inside the nest.\nCREATING HABITAT\nI began my journey by building a bespoke nest, made to the exact specifications of a little owl and placed in a spot I knew the owls would like. Watch this to learn more about how to build a nest for a little owl: https://youtu.be/m9fQcHqUtk8\nATTRACTING A LITTLE OWL\nWithin four days, a little owl turned up to inspect my nest and I watched with baited breath as he brought his mate to see what she thought of it.\nSIGNS THE LITTLE OWL PAIR MAY LAY EGGS\nWhen the female shuffled her body down and began to dig a nesting scrape into the bottom of the nest, I really thought she could choose to lay her eggs here! The pair seemed to really like it, they spent their days keeping guard and their nights mating on perches I built outside\u2026 although things didn't always go to plan!\nCOMPETITION\nBut nest sites are in short supply, and soon a young male kestrel showed an interest in the site. \nLITTLE OWL DEFENCE\nWhen the kestrel pinched the little owl's food, the little owl decided to take action. A little owl is much smaller than a kestrel, but it is fierce and after a tense standoff it was the larger kestrel that retreated.\nA NEW BOX\nThe kestrel needed a nest, so I designed a new, more spacious, box with him in mind. And sure enough the kestrel seemed to like it - watch as he nods his head! But it's not long before this new site is up, it catches the little owl's eye.\nAND ANOTHER CLASH\nLittle owls will usually choose small, dark spaces so I was surprised to see them in this large, light nest site. But they seem delighted and I got to watch some beautiful courtship behaviour. In fact they seem to like it so much they fought the kestrel for it - and a barn owl that also showed an interest.\nLITTLE OWL ATTACK\nThe little owl is a fierce fighter. Incredibly it grabbed a barn owl twice its size and yanked it out of the box.\nTHE PAIR MOVE ON\nThen, after all that, the little owls decided not to nest here. Perhaps they felt the competition was too fierce. Either way I haven't seen the female for some time so I think she must have laid her eggs elsewhere.\nLOOKING OUT FOR CHICKS\nWherever they are nesting, I hope they have a healthy brood and I\u2019ll be keeping a close eye out for chicks. I didn't get to watch them raise their young inside the nest, but I've enjoyed a privileged view into their secret courtship.\nREAD MORE\nIf you would like to learn more about the little owls I follow here in Thixendale, North Yorkshire, and see the paintings they inspire you can read my blog here: https://robertefuller.com/diary/a-window-onto-the-world-of-little-owls/\n\n\nI am a British wildlife artist based in Thixendale, North Yorkshire, UK.

                "description": "Secretary Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have very different views on just about everything.  Jimmy always wonders about whether people are really paying attention to those issues or not. For the most part, he thinks it doesn\u2019t matter what a candidate says, it just matters which candidate says it. To put this theory to the test, we asked diehard members of Team Hillary if they agreed with some stuff Hillary has said. But the quotes we asked about were not from Hillary, they were actually quotes from Donald Trump. So will these Democrats agree with Donald Trump? \n\nMatt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel Return to Couples Counseling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xEULwZS4hc\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n\nWatch the latest Halloween Candy Prank: http://bit.ly/KimmelHalloweenCandy\n\nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/JKLMeanTweets8\n\nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n\nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n\nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n\nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" ABC's late-night talk show.\n \n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" is well known for its huge viral video successes with 2.5 billion views on YouTube alone.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\nCorrection at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.\n\nIn November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city\u2019s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.\n\nIn the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.\n\nSign up for the Missing Chapter newsletter to stay up to date with the series:  https://vox.com/missing-chapter\n\nWatch Ranjani's earlier video on the hidden history of the Tulsa Massacre: https://youtu.be/x-ItsPBTFO0\n\nFor more reading, check out the links below:\n\nThe final report from the state commission on 1898 Wilmington: https://www.ncdcr.gov/learn/resources-topic/1898-wilmington-race-riot-commission \n\nAn in-depth documentary about the events of 1898: http://wilmingtononfire.com/about\n\nThe News and Observer\u2019s recent coverage of 1898: https://www.newsobserver.com/article192293519.html and https://media2.newsobserver.com/content/media/2010/5/3/ghostsof1898.pdf\n\nExplore the full Missing Chapter playlist, including episodes, a creator Q&A, and more! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fR2kt0L4Nihvel4pEDw9od\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Submit a story idea here: http://bit.ly/2RhjxMy\n\nCorrection at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.\n\nIn November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city\u2019s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.\n\nIn the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.\n\nSign up for the Missing Chapter newsletter to stay up to date with the series:  https://vox.com/missing-chapter\n\nWatch Ranjani's earlier video on the hidden history of the Tulsa Massacre: https://youtu.be/x-ItsPBTFO0\n\nFor more reading, check out the links below:\n\nThe final report from the state commission on 1898 Wilmington: https://www.ncdcr.gov/learn/resources-topic/1898-wilmington-race-riot-commission \n\nAn in-depth documentary about the events of 1898: http://wilmingtononfire.com/about\n\nThe News and Observer\u2019s recent coverage of 1898: https://www.newsobserver.com/article192293519.html and https://media2.newsobserver.com/content/media/2010/5/3/ghostsof1898.pdf\n\nExplore the full Missing Chapter playlist, including episodes, a creator Q&A, and more! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fR2kt0L4Nihvel4pEDw9od\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Game developers of the time produced iconic games and introduced genres that are still with us to this day, while working with hardware that had serious limitations.

                "description": "Code used in this tutorial: \n- Blank notebook: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-blank\n- Filled notebook: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-filled\n\nBuilding real-world projects is a great way to apply & improve your machine learning skills. In this workshop, we will walk through the process of building a classical machine learning project using Python & Scikit-learn.\n\nHere's what the workshop covers:\n1. Finding a real-world dataset on Kaggle\n2. Downloading and exploring the data\n3. Preparing the data for machine learning\n4. Creating hardcoded and baseline models\n5. Making predictions and submitting to Kaggle\n6. Trying different models & tuning hyperparameters\n7. Feature engineering, ensembling & other optimizations\n8. Tracking experiments & results systematically\n9. Incorporating ideas from public notebooks & discussions\n10. Documenting and publishing your work online\n\nThe workshop lasts 3 hours, and we write all the code from scratch, starting with a blank Jupyter notebook. Attendees will be able to ask questions live. A recording of the workshop will be shared later, which you can use to follow along and create your own ML project.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis workshop assumes some prior knowledge of classical machine learning.

In this workshop, we will walk through the process of building a classical machine learning project using Python & Scikit-learn.\n\nHere's what the workshop covers:\n1. Finding a real-world dataset on Kaggle\n2. Downloading and exploring the data\n3. Preparing the data for machine learning\n4. Creating hardcoded and baseline models\n5. Making predictions and submitting to Kaggle\n6. Trying different models & tuning hyperparameters\n7. Feature engineering, ensembling & other optimizations\n8. Tracking experiments & results systematically\n9. Incorporating ideas from public notebooks & discussions\n10. Documenting and publishing your work online\n\nThe workshop lasts 3 hours, and we write all the code from scratch, starting with a blank Jupyter notebook. Attendees will be able to ask questions live. A recording of the workshop will be shared later, which you can use to follow along and create your own ML project.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis workshop assumes some prior knowledge of classical machine learning. If you're new to machine learning, you can get started with our free course \"Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs\" at https://zerotogbms.com .\n\nAbout the Speaker \nAakash N S is the founder & CEO of Jovian, a learning platform for data science with a community of 100,000+ data science enthusiasts.

                "description": "This is Part 2 of Unscripted Breaks Down:  The Green Revolution, a three-part series about the socio-economic as well as ecological effects of the Green Revolution on Indian Agriculture. Watch all three parts right here on YouTube.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/qF2xDkphqlY\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/fzHGOvX6lkQ\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/83iZ68s-9YE\n\nThe Green Revolution has always been linked with prosperity and growth yet its policies were highly short-sighted. It sought to increase crop yield in the short term without considering the long-term consequences. The cumulative impact of these policies has been alarming rates of cancer, debt, and suicide. The Green Revolution exploited farmers and made them dependent on harmful fertilisers, GMO seeds, and monoculture which has, in turn, led to irreparable damage to the environment and land.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:02 Effects of HYV seeds on soil fertility \n02:53 Rampant use of harmful 'chemical' fertilizers \n04:21 Chemical fertilizers polluted Punjab's groundwater \n04:37 Monoculture and pesticides go hand in hand\n04:58 Farmers forced to use expensive pesticides\n06:10 Pesticides and cancer \n07:59 Punjab's natural resources are so polluted\n08:21 Depletion of groundwater \n08:37 HYV seeds and water consumption\n09:02 Irrigation trends - Before and After GR \n10.27 Desertification of Punjab in 25 years \n11:47 Farmers forced to burn stubble\n14:16 Bye Crop Diversity, Welcome Malnutrition \n17:36 Farming not profitable anymore\n19:05 Swaminathan committee's report and MSP \n20:15 Farmers are dying due to debts \n22:11 Farmer incomes frozen for 4 decades\n22:46 Farmer protest over the last 30 years\n23:13 Flaws in the current farming model \n\n#farmslaws #farmersprotest \n\nTHE NEXT JUMP \n\nOur new website https://www.unscripted.news/ is now live! \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause journalism is expensive. And while many newsrooms have cut back on their on-ground journalism, ushering in the age of TV news \u2018debates\u2019, that's simply not something we want to do.

                    "description": "This is Part 2 of Unscripted Breaks Down:  The Green Revolution, a three-part series about the socio-economic as well as ecological effects of the Green Revolution on Indian Agriculture. Watch all three parts right here on YouTube.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/qF2xDkphqlY\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/fzHGOvX6lkQ\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/83iZ68s-9YE\n\nThe Green Revolution has always been linked with prosperity and growth yet its policies were highly short-sighted. It sought to increase crop yield in the short term without considering the long-term consequences. The cumulative impact of these policies has been alarming rates of cancer, debt, and suicide. The Green Revolution exploited farmers and made them dependent on harmful fertilisers, GMO seeds, and monoculture which has, in turn, led to irreparable damage to the environment and land.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:02 Effects of HYV seeds on soil fertility \n02:53 Rampant use of harmful 'chemical' fertilizers \n04:21 Chemical fertilizers polluted Punjab's groundwater \n04:37 Monoculture and pesticides go hand in hand\n04:58 Farmers forced to use expensive pesticides\n06:10 Pesticides and cancer \n07:59 Punjab's natural resources are so polluted\n08:21 Depletion of groundwater \n08:37 HYV seeds and water consumption\n09:02 Irrigation trends - Before and After GR \n10.27 Desertification of Punjab in 25 years \n11:47 Farmers forced to burn stubble\n14:16 Bye Crop Diversity, Welcome Malnutrition \n17:36 Farming not profitable anymore\n19:05 Swaminathan committee's report and MSP \n20:15 Farmers are dying due to debts \n22:11 Farmer incomes frozen for 4 decades\n22:46 Farmer protest over the last 30 years\n23:13 Flaws in the current farming model \n\n#farmslaws #farmersprotest \n\nTHE NEXT JUMP \n\nOur new website https://www.unscripted.news/ is now live! \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause journalism is expensive. And while many newsrooms have cut back on their on-ground journalism, ushering in the age of TV news \u2018debates\u2019, that's simply not something we want to do. We want to be out in the field, reporting, researching, and doing work that we believe in, work that is not only time-consuming but increasingly more expensive as we attempt to scale up.\n\nOver the last five years, we have tried to do branded content, native brand messaging, a strategy that has worked successfully for ScoopWhoops\u2019 other divisions, and as we\u2019ve grown, trended, and influenced policy, brands have increasingly reached out to us for collaborations.

Currently made up of 193 Member States, the UN and its work are guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding Charter.\n\nThe UN has evolved over the years to keep pace with a rapidly changing world.\n\nBut one thing has stayed the same: it remains the one place on Earth where all the world\u2019s nations can gather together, discuss common problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity.\n\nGeneral debate website: https://gadebate.un.org/\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0646\u0627\n\u8bf7\u5728\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u7f51\u7edc\u7535\u89c6\uff08UN Web TV\uff09\u89c2\u770b\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u89c6\u9891\nRegardez cette vid\u00e9o en fran\u00e7ais sur UN Web TV\nVean este video en espa\u00f1ol en UN Web TV\n\u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 UN Web TV\nhttps://media.un.org/en/asset/k15/k15r6iuvkp\n\n#UNGA #UnitedNations"

                "description": "Struggling to grow your calves?  \nHere are three strategies to grow bigger calve\n\nFirst, Make sure you train all three heads.  Bent knee calf raises put more emphasis on the soleus, while straight leg calf raises emphasize the gastrocnemius.  Point your Toes out to build the inner part and point your toes in to build the outer part.  \n\nSecond, Prioritize the calves first of the week and first in the workout so you have maximum energy to train them.\n\nFinally, Train them 2-3 times per week\n\nFULL WORKOUT and Diet plan: https://seriousshred.com\n\n\u25ba Heavy Duty Workout Resistance Bands: http://dbolc.com/fI76A\n\u25ba Pullup Resistance Bands: http://dbolc.com/cLfBx\n\u25ba Abs Wheel Roller: http://dbolc.com/iIPnZ\n\u25ba Lifting Straps (My favorite): http://dbolc.com/CfFgF\n\nFollow me on:\nTiktok https://tiktok.com/@deltabolic\nIG: https://Instagram.com/deltabolic\n\nI\u2019ll answer your questions or coach you 1:1 here:\nhttps://stanwith.me/deltabolic \n\nBusiness Inquiries: deltabolic@gmail.com\n\nAnti-Swear Odor Workout Face Masks\nhttps://etsy.me/2DoDpep \u25ba Support me on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/deltabolic",

                    "description": "If you want a stronger squat, you need to determine your optimal squat stance based on your body anatomy.  I\u2019ll show you how to do that. \n\nDepending on how your femur attaches to your pelvis, your femur could rotated backwards called retroversion or rotated forward called anteversion.\n\nIf you have more external rotation and less internal rotation in the lying and seated position, you likely retroverted. The ideal squat stance for you is one with the toes pointed out slightly.\n\nIf you have more internal rotation and less external rotation, you likely anteverted. The ideal squat stance for you is one with the toes pointing directly forward.\n\nFor the FULL WORKOUT and DIET plan: https://seriousshred.com\n\n\u25ba Sign-Up for Amazon Price Free 30-Day Trial: https://amzn.to/33kpB19\n\u25ba Try Audible Plus Free for 30 Days: https://amzn.to/3tfRW3A\n\u25ba Heavy Duty Workout Resistance Bands: http://dbolc.com/fI76A\n\u25ba Pullup Resistance Bands: http://dbolc.com/cLfBx\n\u25ba Abs Wheel Roller: http://dbolc.com/iIPnZ\n\u25ba Lifting Straps (My favorite): http://dbolc.com/CfFgF\n\nFollow me on:\nTiktok @deltabolic\nIG: @deltabolic\n\nI\u2019ll answer your questions or coach you 1:1 here:\nstanwith.me/deltabolic \n\nBusiness Inquiries: deltabolic@gmail.com\n\nAnti-Swear Odor Workout Face Masks\nhttps://etsy.me/2DoDpep \u25ba Support me on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/deltabolic"

IGN's own Bo Moore goes in-depth on how its controller feels, its desktop mode, its price and models, and a whole lot more.\n\nThe Steam Deck, is a handheld gaming PC with a form-factor similar to that of a Nintendo Switch. No hard release date has been given, but the Steam Deck has a launch planned for Holiday 2021, with a pre-order reservation system launching in the near future. The price starts at $399, with models that have more storage at $529 and $649 as well\n\n#IGN #Gaming #SteamDeck",

IGN's own Bo Moore goes in-depth on how its controller feels, its desktop mode, its price and models, and a whole lot more.\n\nThe Steam Deck, is a handheld gaming PC with a form-factor similar to that of a Nintendo Switch. No hard release date has been given, but the Steam Deck has a launch planned for Holiday 2021, with a pre-order reservation system launching in the near future. The price starts at $399, with models that have more storage at $529 and $649 as well\n\n#IGN #Gaming #SteamDeck"

He was a prolific talent on radio, TV, composed thousands of songs, acted in movies, wrote books, was a well-known science skeptic, and the all-around good guy. He is a cofounder of the Tonight Show where he had as guests many of the most famous folks of his time including Elvis Presley and Jerry Lewis. His second marriage was to Jayne Meadows. He died in 2000 after being bumped by another car which broke three of his ribs and caused internal bleeding at 78 years old. I was fortunate to have interviewed him for my TV series on the 1960s. He knew the depression era and the 1950s and was uniquely articulate in presenting his point of view. Search his name on my YouTube channel to find other clips from his interview.",

                "description": "Intro: I have given a talk with this title many times, and it turns out from discussions after the talk I could have just as well have called it \"You and Your Engineering Career,\" or even \"You and Your Career.\" But I left the word \"Research\" in the title because that is what I have most studied. From the previous chapters you have an adequate background for how I made the study, and I need not mention again the names of the famous people I have studied closely. The earlier chapters are, in sense, just a great expansion, with much more detail, of the original talk. This chapter is, in a sense, a summary of the previous chapters.\n\n\n\nThe Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn\" was the capstone course by Dr. Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) for graduate students at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey California. \n\nThis course is intended to instill a \"style of thinking\" that will enhance one's ability to function as a problem solver of complex technical issues. With respect, students sometimes called the course \"Hamming on Hamming\" because he relates many research collaborations, discoveries, inventions and achievements of his own. This collection of stories and carefully distilled insights relates how those discoveries came about. Most importantly, these presentations provide objective analysis about the thought processes and reasoning that took place as Dr. Hamming, his associates and other major thinkers, in computer science and electronics, progressed through the grand challenges of science and engineering in the twentieth century.",

It doesn\u2019t even matter.\nI invented Bitcoin cause fiat is a disaster.\nA man from Japan or a damn hologram?\nI\u2019m the reason open season on crypto began.\n\n[H]\nDoes anybody know what this crypto-thing means?\nTo me, sounds like the new Get Broke Quick scheme,\nA bunch of fools from across the land\nInvesting in something they don\u2019t even understand,\nBuying Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash,\nIt\u2019s all gonna crash, and be gone in a flash.\nAll this unsupported money\u2019s an irrational prank,\nAnd I\u2019ll be laughing all the way to my National Bank.\n \n[S]\nHahahahahah, yeah dude, super funny,\nAs if banks these days still helped people make money.\nThe rich get richer and we follow like we\u2019re all sheep,\nThe banks serve Wall Street, crypto serves all streets,\nThe interest in crypto\u2019s on rapid ascent\nWhat\u2019s your current interest? Half a percent?\nI\u2019m sorry, the bank\u2019s gone past its peak\nBut I want info encrypted, not hacked and leaked.\n \n[H]\nIf this crypto system will be our salvation,\nIt needs to be centralized, needs regulation.\nIf our central database gets\u2026 how you say, \u201chacked?\u201d\nInsurance will just make a case to get your money back.\n\u2018Cause in fact, it\u2019s tracked, and the money leaves a trail.\nCentral currency is strong, cryptocurrency is frail.\nUntraceable money \u2014 wow, so clever.\nOne typo in your address? Now it\u2019s gone forever...\n\nFULL LYRICS on Genius \u25ba http://bit.ly/CoinBars\n\n\nCAST\n---------\nHost: Gift of Gab / Blackalicous \nAlexander Hamilton: EpicLloyd\nSatoshi Nakamoto: TimothyDeLaGhetto\nHamilton posse: Will \u201cV\u201d Randolph, Kaila Love\nSatoshi posse: Adesha Adefela, Johnny Rice\nSatoshi rappers: Lesley Toche, Michael \u201cInverse K\u201d, RyanNicole, Ari \u201cHashbrown\u201d, Frak\nDelegates: Ash Hicks, Kaiy Watts, Rachel Morrison, Carlos Andrickson, Kimberly Hollkamp, Edward Ewell, Rodney Jackson, Marcelo Pereira\n\nSpecial guests:\nAdam Back\nAmanda Natividad\nAnthony Veneziale\nAtul Joshi\nAyliffe Brown\nBen Davenport\nBrian Bland\nCharlie Lee\nDebbie Sterling\nDizaster\nDylan Field\nElena Nadolinski\nErik Torenberg\nIllmac\nIvan Cash\nJames Prestwich\nJessica Scorpio\nJosh McFarland\nLaura Shin\nLily Liu\nMeltem Demirors\nMicky Malka\nMike Belshe\nPat Stay\nReid Hoffman\nSam Altman\nShadi Mehrein\nSonja Perkins\nSoona Amhaz\nTeo Casares\nTheo Hollingsworth\nVinitha Watson\nWences Casares\nYuqing Fan\nZooko Wilcox-O'Hearn\n\n\nCREW \n---------\nExecutive Producer: Reid Hoffman\nProducers: Ian Alas, Beau Lewis\nWriters: Reid Hoffman, Ian Alas, Frak, Beau Lewis, Seth Brown\nDirector: Beau Lewis\nDP: Peter Furia\n\nMusic: AMS www.soundcloud.com/amsbeats, Will \u201cV\u201d Randolph\nMix/master by: Fai, Deep H20z\n\nAssistant Director: Frak\nAssistant Producer: Theo Hollingsworth\nCamera: Tyler McPherron\nBTS camera / edit: Steve Flavin\nGaffer: John Dannenfelser\nGrip: Donovan Gats\nArt department: Jackie Scott\nArt department: Paul B\nCostume: Tatiana\nWalkies: Patrick Dunnam\nCasting: Ken Savage\nSlate: Tyler Lim\nPA: Sharissa Wright\nPA: Kalani Ruidas\n\nSpecial thanks to Erik Torenberg, Alexandra Weiss, Elisa Schreiber, Kaitlin Durkosh, Greg Beato, Saida Sapieva, David Sanford, Fernando Gallegos, Ryan Galvan, Khristian Hernandez, Miguel Hernandez, Andrew Montesano, Rachelle Diamond, Ivan Cash, Conrad Kisunzu, Charles Morgan, Travis \u201cOrganik\u201d Fleetwood\n\nwww.rhymecombinator.com\n\n\nIMAGE CREDITS\n-----------------\n/ Pond5\nShilova_Oksana\n/ Noun Project\nGan Khoon Lay, Endang firmansyah, Luis Prado, Kamaluddin, erikTS, Mooms, Eucalyp, Template, Made by Made, ProSymbols, Michael Wohlwend, Yi Chen/ \n/ iStock\nacilo, stockstudioX\n/ Getty Images\nSean Murphy, sharply_done, John Woodworth\n/ iStockphoto\nTommL \n/ Shutterstock\nnapocska, rob zs \n/ iStock\nmetamorworks \n/ pixy.org\nAntonia Theriault \n/ Storyblocks\ndosochnik220"

                "description": "Hello Friends in this video tutorial I'm showing you how to fix pairing AirDots (Earbuds) connection each other. I'm showing you how to hard reset and make it work again like new.\nI go to Xiaomi store for help to solve this problem but only thing they wanna do, was clicking everything on headphones and told me that it's out of stock and they can give me refund because it's manufacture problem and they can't solve it. \nOf course I don't agree and with one pair working and one not working I spend few hours to find how it's work and a way to resolve the problem. I'm explaining in very detailed and you do exactly what I'm doing in the video than you will see your Earbuds will fixed.\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:35 - Put your AirDots (Earbuds) to each other in the box\n0:40 - Turn off both of AirDrots (Earbuds) by pressing and keeping button on it for 5 seconds\n1:14 - Perform 2 kind of reset\n1:42 - Turn on your AirDots (Earbuds) by pressing and holding button on both of it for 5\nExplained Here:\n------------------------------\nSTEP1. Put your AirDots in the box, make sure that its charged. Delete AirDots (Earbuds) from your device.\nSTEP2. Take out both of your AirDots (Earbuds) from box\nSTEP3. Turn off both of Airdrops by pressing and keeping button on it for 5 seconds (until you see red light)\nSTEP 4. Perform 2 kind of reset (reset of stored Bluetooth device and reset of connection between both AirDots (Earbuds) headphones) To make this reset, press and hold button on both airdrops for 20seconds (headphone have to blink after 10seconds and 20seconds) don't release the buttons until you don't see second blinking lights.\nSTEP 5. Turn on your AirDots (Earbuds) by pressing and holding button on both of it for 5 seconds or put it in box and take it out. (when you take it out from box they will automatically turn on).\nAfter done restart, on right headphone you have to see blinking white light but on left one you have to see no light.

                    "description": "Hello Friends in this video tutorial I'm showing you how to fix pairing AirDots (Earbuds) connection each other. I'm showing you how to hard reset and make it work again like new.\nI go to Xiaomi store for help to solve this problem but only thing they wanna do, was clicking everything on headphones and told me that it's out of stock and they can give me refund because it's manufacture problem and they can't solve it. \nOf course I don't agree and with one pair working and one not working I spend few hours to find how it's work and a way to resolve the problem. I'm explaining in very detailed and you do exactly what I'm doing in the video than you will see your Earbuds will fixed.\nChapters:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:35 - Put your AirDots (Earbuds) to each other in the box\n0:40 - Turn off both of AirDrots (Earbuds) by pressing and keeping button on it for 5 seconds\n1:14 - Perform 2 kind of reset\n1:42 - Turn on your AirDots (Earbuds) by pressing and holding button on both of it for 5\nExplained Here:\n------------------------------\nSTEP1. Put your AirDots in the box, make sure that its charged. Delete AirDots (Earbuds) from your device.\nSTEP2. Take out both of your AirDots (Earbuds) from box\nSTEP3. Turn off both of Airdrops by pressing and keeping button on it for 5 seconds (until you see red light)\nSTEP 4. Perform 2 kind of reset (reset of stored Bluetooth device and reset of connection between both AirDots (Earbuds) headphones) To make this reset, press and hold button on both airdrops for 20seconds (headphone have to blink after 10seconds and 20seconds) don't release the buttons until you don't see second blinking lights.\nSTEP 5. Turn on your AirDots (Earbuds) by pressing and holding button on both of it for 5 seconds or put it in box and take it out. (when you take it out from box they will automatically turn on).\nAfter done restart, on right headphone you have to see blinking white light but on left one you have to see no light. It's mean that there is connection between headphone, and right headphone is waiting for connection with phone.\nSTEP 6. Enjoy and don't forget to subscribe Tips2Fix.\n--------\nProbably it will be enough to perform this reset only on left one headphone because I think that left one have problem with connection but it's only supposition.

                "description": "Bayes' theorem explained with examples and implications for life.\nCheck out Audible: http://ve42.co/audible\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nI didn't say it explicitly in the video, but in my view the Bayesian trap is interpreting events that happen repeatedly as events that happen inevitably. They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Jeff Straathof, Donal Botkin, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Saeed Alghamdi\n\nUseful references:\nThe Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver\nThe Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes\u2019 Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nBayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Flourishing Views 3\"",

                    "description": "Bayes' theorem explained with examples and implications for life.\nCheck out Audible: http://ve42.co/audible\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nI didn't say it explicitly in the video, but in my view the Bayesian trap is interpreting events that happen repeatedly as events that happen inevitably. They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Jeff Straathof, Donal Botkin, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Saeed Alghamdi\n\nUseful references:\nThe Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver\nThe Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes\u2019 Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n\nBayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Flourishing Views 3\""

                "description": "Explosive hydroforming, also known as HERF (High Energy Rate Forming) or exploform, is a striking alternative to the more traditional process of metal hydroforming. Unlike this older method, which shapes metal using pressurized hydraulic fluid pumped into a forming chamber, HERF techniques utilize an explosive charge to create the necessary pressure. Although the charge is relatively small, it is capable of generating enough force to mold the associated metal into the die.\n\nThe explosive charge is typically positioned at a specific distance from the workpiece, and both are immersed in fluid, usually hydraulic fluid or simple water. Certain facilities may also use oil, gelatin, liquid salts, or regular air as the transmission medium. However, water is the most commonly used medium as it is the least expensive, excellent for creating uniform peak pressure, and readily available. Once the charge and workpiece are properly positioned, the charge is detonated, pressing the workpiece into a die. The part is then removed and the process is repeated if necessary.\n\nExplosive Hydroforming Methods\nExplosive hydroforming techniques fall into two basic categories. Although both methods function according to the same general principles, they rely on very different placement of the explosive charge within the forming chamber.\n\nStandoff Method: With the Standoff Method, the explosive charge is used in conjunction with an intervening medium. In most hydroforming applications, the intervening material is typically water, oil, or air. The required deformation level dictates how far the explosive charge is placed from the piece of metal to be formed. When the charge detonates, the ensuing force is transmitted through the fluid and pressures the metal into the die. Detonations used in the Standoff Method can often reach several thousand pounds per square inch (psi).\n\nContact Method: In the Contact Method, an explosive charge is placed in direct contact with the forming metal. This process generates far more pressure than the more conventional Standoff Method. By placing the explosive charge in close proximity to the surface material, the detonation can result in as much as several million psi.\n\n\n#hydroforming #explosive #steelwork",

To understand the background of the events, documentary covers the aftermath of Delhi Assembly elections where BJP was defeated by Aam Aadmi Party. During this time many protestors were opposing CAA - NRC. On 22nd February hundreds of women were protesting at Jaffrabad metro station, and this sit in protest covered a stretch of Seelampur- Jaffrabad-Maujpur road. Reportedly clashes broke out after BJP Leader Kapil Mishra gae a provocative speech at Maujpur chowk, allegedly threatening to take matter in their own hands. The riots lasted for more than three days. The documentary covers 11 case studies from across the riot affected areas of North East Delhi and nearby places. The Lallantop also reaches out to the people who were directly affected by the violence, and 1 year down the line how their lives have changed and has justice been served.

                    "description": "#DelhiRiots2020 #RajatSainRoohani #LallantopDocumentary \n\nIn this special documentary '\u0926\u0939\u0932\u0940' - Chronicles of Delhi Riots 2020' by Rajat Sain and Roohani for The Lallantop, we trace the origins of the devastating Delhi Riots that rocked the national capital in 2020. To understand the background of the events, documentary covers the aftermath of Delhi Assembly elections where BJP was defeated by Aam Aadmi Party. During this time many protestors were opposing CAA - NRC. On 22nd February hundreds of women were protesting at Jaffrabad metro station, and this sit in protest covered a stretch of Seelampur- Jaffrabad-Maujpur road. Reportedly clashes broke out after BJP Leader Kapil Mishra gae a provocative speech at Maujpur chowk, allegedly threatening to take matter in their own hands. The riots lasted for more than three days. The documentary covers 11 case studies from across the riot affected areas of North East Delhi and nearby places. The Lallantop also reaches out to the people who were directly affected by the violence, and 1 year down the line how their lives have changed and has justice been served.

Then I downloaded the apk file from playstore and converted it into zip. Then opened it's obb file and luckily it contained data.unity3d which means FAUG is made in Unity game engine.\n\nThen I used uTinyRipper to decompile the whole project and gather assets from it.\n\nHere are the Tools I used to decompile the project :\nuTinyRipper: https://sourceforge.net/projects/utinyripper/\ndnSpy: https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases\niL2cpp: https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper/releases\n\nAfter extracting, I opened up the project in Unity. The original project was made in unity 2017.04.0f1 but in this video, I used unity 2019.1\nI fixed the missing textures and was able to recover the whole map.\n\nHowever, the decompiler I used to recover the source code/game scripts didn't work as intended. So I was not able to gather the scripts. But I could see the class names, function names, function structures and we got some leaked future updates from it.\n\nIt seems like FAU-G's developer nCore games is going to use Photon for their multiplayer. You can learn more about photon here : https://www.photonengine.com/pun\n\nThanks for watching I hoped you liked the video.

Why all the hate for the Jews? \n\nBefore we look at why people hate Jews, also known as Antisemitism, we need to define \u201cJew.\u201d A Jew is someone who identifies with the cultural community whose traditional religion is Judaism and who traces their ancestry to the ancient Hebrew people of Israel, all the way back to Abraham. Jewish people are considered an ethnoreligious group. Both an ethnic group and a religion. There are plenty who identify as Jews yet are not religious. Israel\u2019s Law of Return, which is the law that gives Jews the right to visit and be a citizen of Israel, says a Jew is someone with either a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism. \n\nAnyway, during the time of Jesus in ancient Israel, many were of course Jewish, including Jesus himself. After Jesus died, his followers started a new religion called Christianity. As Christianity spread, and as more and more Roman emperors converted to the religion, Jews became marginalized in society, even though Jews worshipped the same God as Christians did. Roman rulers viewed the refusal of the Jewish community to accept Jesus as the Messiah as a threat. They straight up passed laws that discriminated against Jews. In the year 399, a law saying Jews couldn\u2019t marry Christians, in 439, a law saying Jews couldn\u2019t hold positions in government. In 531, a law saying they couldn\u2019t appear as witnesses against Christians in court. Rumors began to spread that Jews had horns and tails, and that they killed Christian children and used their blood for rituals.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, many societies forced Jews to live in segregated ghettos and wear special clothing. The Catholic Church did not allow Jews to own land, so Jews couldn\u2019t build up wealth through property. However, the Church also didn\u2019t let Christians loan money for profit. Jews could, so they often turned to money lending to build up wealth. Due to the fact that nearly every moneylender happened to be Jewish, this ended up creating a stereotype that Jews were greedy. I mean, people who loan money and charge interest throughout history have rarely been seen in a positive light, amIright? Christian rulers used Jewish money to build extravagant churches and build up armies.\n\nBy the 11th century, Christianity dominated Europe, and the main minority religion was Judaism. Jews seemed to be the one group Christians could not convert, seen as outsiders. By this time, the Catholic Church was even teaching that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. And then, the Black Death. During the 14th century, the bubonic plague spread quickly across Europe, killing around \u2153 of its entire population. Since this was before science, people had no idea what was causing it. Due to superstition and fear, and without any evidence whatsoever, Christians blamed Jews for causing the plague, accusing them of poisoning wells to spread the disease.",

The horizontal axis shows the number of neutrons, and the vertical one the number of protons, not the other way round. Sorry about that!!\n\nAddendum to what I say at 4 mins 20 seconds: Some of the elements heavier than iron are created by also capturing protons. \n\nWhere do all the atoms come from? When where they made and how? Is it true that we are all made of \"stardust\" that supernovae spit out when they die?

The horizontal axis shows the number of neutrons, and the vertical one the number of protons, not the other way round. Sorry about that!!\n\nAddendum to what I say at 4 mins 20 seconds: Some of the elements heavier than iron are created by also capturing protons. \n\nWhere do all the atoms come from? When where they made and how? Is it true that we are all made of \"stardust\" that supernovae spit out when they die?

                "description": "The deep sea\u2014Earth's largest habitat\u2014is home to a host of magical and mysterious animals. As we help our education and conservation partners at the Monterey Bay Aquarium prepare for the exhibit Into the Deep: Exploring Our Undiscovered Ocean, launching in 2022, they were curious to know which denizens of the deep are our favorites? With that question in mind, we gathered five of MBARI\u2019s finest deep-sea biologists\u2014Shannon Johnson, Kakani Katija, George Matsumoto, Bruce Robison, and Susan von Thun\u2014and came up with a list of ten favorites. You might be surprised to see what made our list and what makes these creatures so lovable.\n\nFor more than three decades, MBARI researchers have been exploring the deep ocean with remotely operated vehicles, discovering fascinating ways that life in the deep sea has evolved to thrive in this dark, cold world. Our ocean is vast and full of things yet unseen. Every time we set out on an expedition, we are amazed by new observations and we are excited to share ten of those discoveries with you! \n\n\n\nLearn more about MBARI research and the incredible discoveries we've made as we explore the ocean at https://www.mbari.org.\n\nMonterey Bay Aquarium video production team: Christy Chamberlain, Presley Adamson\nEditor: Lou Laprocido\nMBARI video production team: Kyra Schlining, Susan von Thun, Nancy Jacobsen Stout, Heidi Cullen\n\n\nFollow MBARI on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MBARInews/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MBARI_News\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mbari_news/\nTumblr: https://mbari-blog.tumblr.com\nLinkdIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/monterey-bay-aquarium-research-institute-mbari-/\n\nFollow the Monterey Bay Aquarium on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MontereyAq  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/montereybaya...  \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/montereybay... \nTumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/montereyb...   \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/montereyaq \nTikTok now too: https://www.tiktok.com/@montereyaq",

                    "description": "The deep sea\u2014Earth's largest habitat\u2014is home to a host of magical and mysterious animals. As we help our education and conservation partners at the Monterey Bay Aquarium prepare for the exhibit Into the Deep: Exploring Our Undiscovered Ocean, launching in 2022, they were curious to know which denizens of the deep are our favorites? With that question in mind, we gathered five of MBARI\u2019s finest deep-sea biologists\u2014Shannon Johnson, Kakani Katija, George Matsumoto, Bruce Robison, and Susan von Thun\u2014and came up with a list of ten favorites. You might be surprised to see what made our list and what makes these creatures so lovable.\n\nFor more than three decades, MBARI researchers have been exploring the deep ocean with remotely operated vehicles, discovering fascinating ways that life in the deep sea has evolved to thrive in this dark, cold world. Our ocean is vast and full of things yet unseen. Every time we set out on an expedition, we are amazed by new observations and we are excited to share ten of those discoveries with you! \n\n\n\nLearn more about MBARI research and the incredible discoveries we've made as we explore the ocean at https://www.mbari.org.\n\nMonterey Bay Aquarium video production team: Christy Chamberlain, Presley Adamson\nEditor: Lou Laprocido\nMBARI video production team: Kyra Schlining, Susan von Thun, Nancy Jacobsen Stout, Heidi Cullen\n\n\nFollow MBARI on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MBARInews/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MBARI_News\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mbari_news/\nTumblr: https://mbari-blog.tumblr.com\nLinkdIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/monterey-bay-aquarium-research-institute-mbari-/\n\nFollow the Monterey Bay Aquarium on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MontereyAq  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/montereybaya...  \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/montereybay... \nTumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/montereyb...   \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/montereyaq \nTikTok now too: https://www.tiktok.com/@montereyaq"

Here is my story behind this song. \n\"I was born in Chennai in a multicultural family with different genres of music and with friends from diverse backgrounds. I\u2019ve always been fascinated with the wonders of life. As Mawlana Rumi says - \u201cThere are a thousand ways to kneel and kiss the ground; there are a thousand ways to go home again\u201d. The video's main character Amal was created with such experiences of mine and the longing to explore the unknown. I hope all of you find your own journey of the unknown. \n\nSpecial thanks to Lata Mangeshkar Ji who has been my inspiration to sing and thank you for personally taking the time in calling and giving me your kind compliments and showering me with your blessings. \n\nThanks to the almighty, my grandmother Kareema Begum, my maternal grandfather - Abdul Sattar, mom, dad, Raheema, Ameen, my maternal uncles and aunts and my cousins from the maternal and paternal side, my teachers - Shruti Jauhari, Murtaza, Nirbhay Saxena, Mira Sengupta, Lavita Lobo, and Sterlin Nithya, my music business professor - Ritnika Nayan, all my teachers from Fathima School, Good Shepherd, Stella Maris, and B.S.S. Crescent university who have encouraged and motivated me during my time with them. \n\nAnd most importantly to all of you who have been behind the scenes and who have continuously supported me by your prayers and positivity, all of this has happened because of your love and strength. Continue spreading that for every artist and human being and give more love and strength to them. \n\nThanks to the media for all your encouragement in the beginning of my music journey. \n\nCredits:\nDirected by A.R.

                "description": "It has got to be said, I am quite the anthem junkie. One thing that's always fascinated me is the TV sign-off. Before the advent of twenty-four-hour television, channels would shut off broadcasts at a given time each night and show a \"sign-off\" to tell viewers to turn off the TV. Most channels all around the world (including this one, TB CCCP) showed the national anthem accompanied by patriotic images or videos; others (Like RT\u00c9 in Ireland) would broadcast a prayer or religious song. \n\nThe practice of \"signing-off\" has largely grown out of fashion around much of the world because TV channels either show programming through the night or fill the wee hours with advertising. However, a few local stations in the USA have reintroduced the practice as a means to instil patriotism and Radio 4 in the UK also still plays \"God Save the Queen\" daily. \n\nFinding the anthem sign off for TV in the USSR was... difficult to say the least. There seem to be a lot of videos on English-speaking youtube of the anthem itself, but none of the wider sign-off process around it. I had heard of a USSR anthem sign-off in various forums but I never found a video of it. In fact, it was only through the help of Yanex (\"Russian Google\") and Google Translate that I was able to find this archive footage on a Russian-language site. It shows the CCCP TB (Soviet equivalent of BBC/NHK) end of day sign off from the 1980s.\n\nTo aid English-language viewers, I have added subtitles throughout this video showing a translation of the original Russian anthem. Please turn on \"closed captions\" and select \"English\" if you would like to see them (the translation is an original by myself, feel free to use it for any use whatsoever).\n\nThis video is particularly interesting because it features the famous \"turn off your TV\" notice at the very end. Legend has it that this was included because Soviet TVs had a nasty habit of exploding and starting house fires when they were left on overnight. \n\nI translated and uploaded this USSR TV startup video for fellow anthem-enthusiasts and it is NOT a political endorsement/message of any kind. Please keep the comments civil. Furthermore, Russian copyright law declares that all Soviet state symbols including this anthem are in the public domain.\n\n\nCredits to Macheath \nfor making a Californian frame-by-frame remake of this very video: https://youtu.be/XvlqiUoIIJs\n\n\n\n- Nick",

I\u2019m pretty sure he was trained to react after splashing people, but this is still adorable. \n\nI was sitting next to an elderly woman in a wheelchair trying to get a photo of the belugas as they swam by, when Juno swam up and seemed fascinated by us. He rose to the top and splashed me. I laughed and gave a playful pretend tap to let Juno know I was reacting and that they got me good (I did not actually hit the tank, even if it looks like it in the video). And then he started laughing back and waving his fins. It looked exactly like he had planned and executed a funny prank - and knew it!\n\nMy daughter Kayla Muchnick happened to be filming the beluga behind me and caught this hilarious candid moment by chance. \n\nAfter this video, he actually did the same thing to the woman in the wheelchair next to me. She was understandably less amused than I was. But Juno laughed all the same.

                "description": "India sealed a historic series victory in Pakistan, their first overseas series win in more than a decade, as they bowled Pakistan out for 245 in their second innings, to win by an innings and 131 runs. The day was full of drama, as the Indians, full of nervous energy, dropped catch after catch in the morning, six of them in just the first 40 minutes. But the Indian bowlers kept their patience, and continued bowling with accuracy and fire to take the eight wickets that they needed to achieve a milestone that this Indian team has come so agonisingly close to in the past, only to falter on the last lap. As the last wicket fell, the Indians rose as one in cathartic delight, purged, like the rest of their nation, of the sense of incompleteness that had lingered for so long. \n#WinningMoments #IndiavsPakistan",

V. Pandit\nRavi Gupta\nBobby Bedi\nMusic : Piyush Kanojia\nTaufiq Qureshi\nKuldeep Singh \nLabel : DRJ Records\n#TrainToPakistan#NirmalPandey,MohanAgashe#SuperhitAction#\nTrain to Pakistan is a 1998 Indian Hindi film adapted from Khushwant Singh's 1956 classic novel by the same name set in the Partition of India of 1947 and directed by Pamela Rooks.[1] The film stars Nirmal Pandey, Rajit Kapur, Mohan Agashe, Smriti Mishra, Mangal Dhillon and Divya Dutta.\nThe film is set in Mano Majra, which is a quiet village on the border of India and Pakistan, close to where the railway line crosses the Sutlej River. The film develops around the love affair of small-time dacoit Juggut Singh (Nirmal Pandey), with a local Muslim girl, Nooran (Smriti Mishra). Mano Majra, incidentally, was the original title of the book upon its release in 1956.[2] The villagers are a mix of Sikhs and Muslims, who live in harmony. The Sikhs own most of the land, and the Muslims work as labourers. During the summer of 1947, when the Partition of India was taking place, the entire country was a hotbed of extremism and intolerance. The Muslims in India moved towards the newly formed Pakistan, and the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan migrated to refugee camps in India. One day, a train arrives from Pakistan, which carries bodies of all the travellers who have been butchered while they tried to depart from Pakistan. That is when this quiet village is changed forever.[1]\nInitially, the film was to have its premiere on STAR Plus channel on 15 August 1997, India's Independence day, but it ran into trouble with the Indian Censor Board, thus its theatrical release was also cancelled twice, and with director not agreeing to the cuts demanded by the board, the film went to a tribunal, which caused further delays. Eventually it was passed in December 1997 with a few cuts, mostly audio. Its television released happened on Star Plus in 1998, after its theatrical release.[6] The film version had only one visual and few audio cuts. Subsequently, the film was released in the United States, Sri Lanka and on Channel Four in the UK, and also shown in several international film festivals,[3] including, Zanzibar International Film Festival, 1998, World Film Festival National Films from South Festival Denmark, 1998, Beirut International Film Festival, 1998, Fiminale International Film Festival, Koln Germany, 1998, Soria Mora Film Festival, Oslo, 1998, and Indian Film Week in Hong Kong, 2000.[7] Besides critical acclaim, it was also nominated for Best Film at the 1999 Cinequest Film Festival.[8]\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE for the Latest Videos, Movies, Songs and scenes, all in ONE channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCogmcYcqWY5PxzqPdt89_kA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to DRJ Records Now Youtube Channel, the #1 destination for premium entertainment videos.

Due to the high degree of habituation the reserve offers outstanding photographic opportunities, particularly of the elusive leopard. The valuable water source supplied by the Sabie and Sand rivers ensure that this diverse land sustains one of the highest concentrations of animal species to be found anywhere in Africa.\n\nWildlife highlights: Leopard, lion, rhino, elephant, buffalo, antelope, avifauna"

                "description": "CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin reports on comments from venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya last week on letting companies go bankrupt during the coroanvirus pandemic.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of investment firm Social Capital, told CNBC on Thursday that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be bailing out billionaires and hedge funds during the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\u201cOn Main Street today, people are getting wiped out. Right now, rich CEOs are not, boards that have horrible governance are not. People are,\u201d Palihapitiya, an early Facebook executive, said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money Halftime Report.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is disproportionately prop up poor-performing CEOs and boards, and you have to wash these people out.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust to be clear on who we are talking about. We\u2019re talking about a hedge fund that serves a bunch of billionaire family offices, who cares? They don\u2019t get the summer in the Hamptons?\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the people that purport to be the most sophisticated investors in the world.\u201d\n\nPalihapitiya also said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to support to economy during the COVID-19 crisis are going to have consequences.\n\nThe Fed earlier in the day announced a slew of new moves aimed at getting another $2.3 trillion of financing into businesses and governments, including its Main Street business lending program and market interventions. The central bank said its loans will be geared toward businesses with up to 10,000 employees and less than $2.5 billion in revenues for 2019. Programs would total up to $2.3 trillion and include the Payroll Protection Program and other measures aimed at getting money to small businesses and bolstering municipal finances with a $500 billion lending program, it added. \n\nBut Palihapitiya said it would have been better to just give more money to Americans. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not disagreeing with what the Fed has to do. What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s creating a land mine, and it\u2019s creating a bill that will have to come due,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be better for the Fed to have given half a million to every man, woman and child in the United States,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new measures add to an already aggressive strategy by the Fed to keep markets functioning and support the economy, which has been hit by public health measures aimed at slowing the coronavirus spread. \n\nFor access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: \nhttps://cnb.cx/2JdMwO7 \n \n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n \nTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.
